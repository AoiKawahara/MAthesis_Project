## Abstract of Thesis

This study investigates public reactions to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July 2024 by applying computational methods, specifically topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to text data from X in English. Focusing on nine days before and after the incident, the research explores how such hostile violence toward a politician shapes public discourse and emotional responses in the current digital era. Building upon existing theoretical discussions, this study explores how public opinion responds in real time to political violence. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the analysis identifies dynamics of how attention moved from partisan reactions to broader concerns about media narratives and the presidential election trajectory. Aspect-based sentiment analysis using VADER, along with interrupted time series analysis, captures dynamic emotional fluctuations. Sentiments toward Trump became temporarily more positive, reflecting the empathy effect, but at the same time, ranging from sympathy and fear to skepticism and political anxiety. These findings highlight how political violence can both unite and divide public sentiment.

Several studies have explored the impact of Trump's assassination attempt on public opinion, including:

- **Holliday, Lelkes, & Westwood (2024)**: The July 2024 Trump assassination attempt was followed by lower in-group support for partisan violence and increased group unity.
- **Mustaqim & Haroni (2024)**: From a Victim to a Hero: A Visual Rhetoric of Donald Trump’s Attempted Assassination.

These studies provide my study a foundation for understanding the mixed interpretation of the effect of Trump's assassination attempt on public opinion.
